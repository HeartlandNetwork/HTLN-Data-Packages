# HTLN-Data-Package-Scripts

This repo contains R scripts that have been used to generate data packages for 
Heartland Network "Vital Signs" datasets. Currently, there are published data packages
for breeding birds and fish communities:

We have draft data packages currently under review for invasive plants, white-tailed
dee and western prairie fringed orchid. A data package for Missouri bladderpod is
currently being finalized. Many thanks to Rob Baker and the NPS Ft Collins Data 
Strike Team for this work including Issac Quevedo, Abigail Hobbs and James Brown.

A separate data package is currently under development for HTLN Wetlands monitoring
- ORAM wetlands assessments at Cuyohoga Valley National Park.
