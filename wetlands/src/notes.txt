Go back to MS Access front end, the corresponding Access file is here:

C:\Users\GRowell\work\Databases\Wetlands\20240528-ORAM-pub

The export format of tbl_ORAMSMetrics1Denorm and tbl_ORAMSMetrics2Denorm were
different. Are the table datatypes actually different between the two.

If so, do I want to make them match in R or in the database. Leaning towards
cleaning them up in R for the publishable dataframe and not try re-design anything
in the Access database. 

On next session, go into HTLNWetlands2.4.0.accdb and look at the datatypes for the
two denorm tables. If they are different, don't sweat it. We are going to create
a workflow in R and validate it against a dozen or so ORAMS. Then we will test it
metric by metric to ensure it behaves as it should.

Bye for now...
